Machine for labs;
Option 1 (best) -- Your own machine with your own config, with Java 17, provided you can share the screen with me to get help/feedback during lab.
Option 2 (entirely adequate) -- Virtual machine we provide
Option 3 (not really satisfactory, but better than nothing) your own machine that you cannot share the screen with us.

My git repo should be "read-only". Write your own code in a project and repo of your own. If you edit mine, it'll simply give you merge conflicts when I update it!

Initial assignment:
- "represent" a student, with name, average grade (gpa), taking several courses (courses are only the textual name)
- print a list of all students
- print a list of "smart" students
- assume that this is the beginning of a long-term, business critical, series of applications (all data in memory)
- enough sample data to demonstrate but don't get carried away (e.g. three students is [barely] sufficient)
